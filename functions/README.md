# Cloudflared builds on drone.io

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/danacr/drone-cloudflared/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/danacr/drone-cloudflared)

Current version: 2019.9.0

When trying to download cloudlfared for Arm64, I noticed that there were no binaries available:

Since drone.io supports arm64 builds, I decided to build a separate pipeline just for these builds.

Please find the latest version in the releases section.
